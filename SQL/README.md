# Answering business questions with SQLite: the Chinook Database
This is an assignment from the Dataquest course on using SQL to answer business questions. Dataquest provides the database (from a fictional record store) and the questions to be answered, as well as some bonus questions for motivated learners.
I used RStudio for this project, with the package RSQLite. The aim is mainly to help the store (Chinook) decide which new songs or albums to purchase, whether to change their purchasing strategy (e.g., from targeting individual tracks to albums), which markets they could expand to, and to start evaluating the performance of three employees.

### The files
This folder contains both the original script, `dataquest_SQLite.Rmd`, and the resulting HTML report, `dataquest_SQLite.nb.html`. However, GitHub only supports viewing the raw form of HMTL files, so you can click [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/angelajjones/portfolio/blob/main/SQL/dataquest_SQLite.nb.html) to see the compiled report.
