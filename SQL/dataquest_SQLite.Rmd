First, the setup.
Connect to Chinook database:
```{r}
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)

db <- "chinook.db"
conn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), db)
tables <- dbListTables(conn)

```
Make helper functions and display a list of tables contained in the database:
```{r helper}
run_query <- function(query) {
  conn <- dbConnect(SQLite(), db)
  result <- dbGetQuery(conn, query)
 # dbDisconnect(conn)
  return(result)
}

show_tables <- function(){
   query <- "SELECT name, type FROM sqlite_master WHERE type IN ('table', 'view')"
  return(run_query(query))
}

show_tables()

```
Here is the relational schema for this database: 
![(Source: Dataquest exercise instructions)](../chinook_RS.png)

Next, set theme for plots:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
my_theme <- theme(axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(size = 0.25),
                  axis.line.y.left = element_line(size = 0.25),
                  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
                  panel.grid = element_blank())

theme_set(my_theme)
```


# The situation:

The Chinook record store has just signed a deal with a new record label, and we are in charge of choosing the first three albums to be added to the store. There are four albums to choose from, and all four are by artists who don't have any tracks in the store right now. Here is the list of artist names and the genre of music they produce:

| Artist name          | Genre   |
|----------------------|---------|
| Regal                | Hip-Hop |
| Red Tone             | Punk    |
| Meteor and the Girls | Pop     |
| Slim Jim Bites       | Blues   |

The record label specializes in artists from the US, so they have given Chinook some money to advertise the new albums in the USA. In order to choose which albums to buy, we need to identify the best-selling genres in the USA. 


# Which new albums should be added?
## 1. Which genres sell the most in the USA?
Solution with SQL query as string: 
```{r sql query genre}
to_purchase <- '
WITH usa_sales AS
   (
    SELECT il.* 
    FROM invoice_line AS il
    INNER JOIN invoice AS i ON il.invoice_id = i.invoice_id
    INNER JOIN customer AS c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE c.country = "USA"
   )
SELECT
    g.name AS genre,
    count(us.invoice_line_id) AS tracks_sold,
    cast(count(us.invoice_line_id) AS FLOAT)/(
        SELECT COUNT(*) from usa_sales
    ) AS percentage_tracks_sold
FROM usa_sales AS us
INNER JOIN track AS t ON t.track_id = us.track_id
INNER JOIN genre g ON g.genre_id = t.genre_id
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY percentage_tracks_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
'
run_query(to_purchase)
```

Solution with SQL chunk:
```{sql connection=conn, output.var="top_10_sales"}
WITH usa_sales AS
   (
    SELECT il.* 
    FROM invoice_line AS il
    INNER JOIN invoice AS i ON il.invoice_id = i.invoice_id
    INNER JOIN customer AS c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id
    WHERE c.country = "USA"
   )
SELECT
    g.name AS genre,
    COUNT(us.invoice_line_id) AS tracks_sold,
    CAST(COUNT(us.invoice_line_id) AS FLOAT)/(
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM usa_sales
    ) AS percentage_tracks_sold
FROM usa_sales AS us
INNER JOIN track AS t ON t.track_id = us.track_id
INNER JOIN genre g ON g.genre_id = t.genre_id
GROUP BY genre
ORDER BY percentage_tracks_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 2. Plot the data
```{r plot top 10 genres}
library(ggplot2)
# Note that I use the "top_10_sales" variable generated as the output of the SQL chunk above. Without the SQL chunk, the result of run_query(to_purchase) needs to be assigned to a variable so it can be used in R.

top_genres_plot <- ggplot(data = top_10_sales, aes(x = reorder(genre, -percentage_tracks_sold), y = percentage_tracks_sold)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "orange") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Percent of total tracks sold in USA") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1))
  

top_genres_plot
```
## Conclusion
It seems that Rock, Alternative & Punk, and Metal are the 3 top-selling music genres in the USA, so we should include the Punk album by Red Tone. However, we don't have any new Rock or Metal albums available, so we should choose the next best genres: Blues and Pop. 

In sum, the following three albums will be recommended:
* Red Tone (Punk)
* Slim Jim Bites (Blues)
* Meteor and the Girls (Pop).

It would be worth asking the record label if they have any new Rock albums, because this genre is overwhelmingly the bestseller.

# Assessment of sales support rep performance
## 1. Gather all potentially relevant data
```{sql connection=conn, output.var="employee_perf"}
WITH sales_per_rep AS 
(
SELECT 
i.customer_id,
c.support_rep_id,
SUM(i.total) AS total_sales
FROM invoice AS i
INNER JOIN customer AS c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
GROUP BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
e.first_name || " " || e.last_name AS employee,
e.reports_to AS supervisor,
e.hire_date AS hire_date,
e.birthdate AS birthdate,
e.country AS country,
SUM(spr.total_sales) as total_sold
FROM sales_per_rep AS spr
INNER JOIN employee AS e ON e.employee_id = spr.support_rep_id
GROUP BY employee;

```

## 2. Plot the data
```{r plot employee perf}
e_perf_plot <- ggplot(data = employee_perf, aes(x = reorder(employee, -total_sold), y = total_sold)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "cyan3") +
  xlab("Sales Support Rep") +
  ylab("Total sales ($)") 
                       
e_perf_plot                        
```
Jane Peacock has the highest sales amount among the Sales Support Reps. Most of the available employee characteristics are the same between each of the reps, except for date of hire and birth date. It's unlikely that age has a big impact on their sales, but more experienced employees may sell more due to various factors like increased skill or rapport with clients. 
Let's visualize how long each employee has been with the company:

```{r plot employee time since hire, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate) 
library(tidyverse)

hire_timeline <- employee_perf %>%
  select(employee, hire_date, birthdate) %>%
  mutate(hire_date = lubridate::as_date(hire_date),
         time_since_hire = lubridate::today() - hire_date,
         birthdate = lubridate::as_date(birthdate),
         age = (lubridate::today() - birthdate)/365)


plot_time <- ggplot(data = hire_timeline, aes(x = reorder(employee, time_since_hire), y = time_since_hire)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "sienna1") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Time since hire (days)") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
plot_time
```
Let's also look at their respective ages, keeping in mind that we don't know enough about these employees to know what other factors influencing their performance might be correlated with age. This means that even if we find big differences in age, we can't draw any firm conclusions about their relationship to employee sales.

```{r plot age, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
age_plot <- ggplot(data = hire_timeline, aes(x = reorder(employee, age), y = age)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightgoldenrod2") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Age (years)") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 0))
age_plot

```

## Conclusion:
Jane Peacock has been with the company the longest, but not by much longer than Margaret Park, so it seems unlikely that this has had a significant effect on her performance, unless she had relevant experience in sales before she joined the company. She is also the youngest, but Margaret Park is the oldest, yet has the second-highest total dollar amount of sales, so it's also unlikely that age can explain the observed differences in performance. 
A more detailed view of these employees' work patterns, like working hours and total number of days worked, and/or their professional background, is needed to better explain this variability. 

# Sales for each different country (ignoring country data from invoice table)
## 1. Gather the data
```{sql connection=conn, output.var="sales_bycountry"}
WITH dummy_code AS 
(
SELECT 
     CASE WHEN (
                SELECT COUNT(*) 
                FROM customer AS c
                WHERE country = c.country
                ) = 1 THEN "Other"
          ELSE c.country
    END AS country,
    c.customer_id,
    il.*
FROM invoice_line AS il
INNER JOIN invoice aS i ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id
INNER JOIN customer AS c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
)

SELECT 
country,
customers,
total_sales,
average_sales_per_c,
average_order_val
FROM 
(
    SELECT 
    country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers,
    SUM(unit_price) AS total_sales,
    SUM(unit_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS average_sales_per_c,
    SUM(unit_price)/COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_id) AS average_order_val,
    CASE
      WHEN country = "Other" THEN 1
      ELSE 0
    END AS sorting
    FROM dummy_code
    GROUP BY country
    ORDER BY sorting ASC, total_sales DESC
);

```

```{r}
# temporary stopgap to correct "Other" labeling as even solution provided by Dataquest did not work 

sales_bycountry <- sales_bycountry %>% 
  mutate(country = if_else(customers == 1, "Other", country)) 
```

## 2. Plots
Number of customers by country (excluding "Other" countries which had only 1 customer):
```{r plot n_customers, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
sales_bycountry_cut <-  sales_bycountry %>% filter(country != "Other")

cust <- ggplot(data = sales_bycountry_cut, aes(x = reorder(country, -customers), y = customers, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of customers") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")

cust

```

Total sales by country (again excluding "Other"):
```{r plot sales by country, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tot_sold <- ggplot(data = sales_bycountry_cut, aes(x = reorder(country, -total_sales), y = total_sales, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Total sales ($)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")

tot_sold
```
Average sales per customer:
```{r plot avg sales per c, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sales_per_c <- ggplot(data = sales_bycountry_cut, aes(x = reorder(country, -average_sales_per_c), y = average_sales_per_c, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Average value of sales per customer ($)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")

sales_per_c
```
Average order value by country:
```{r plot avg order val, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
order_val <- ggplot(data = sales_bycountry_cut, aes(x = reorder(country, -average_order_val), y = average_order_val, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Average order value ($)") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none")

order_val

```
# Conclusion
The USA is the biggest market, largely because it has the most customers, as these customers are not the biggest spenders. The data shows that the biggest spenders are in the Czech Republic, where both the average value of sales per customer and the average order value are highest despite it having one of the smallest numbers of customers (though note that the average order value varies relatively little between countries so it might not be the most meaningful metric). 

Based on this data, the Czech Republic seems like a market with potential for growth. Perhaps other countries with few customers but relatively high average sales values per customer and/or order vales, as well as large populations with access to the internet (e.g., Portugal, India, United Kingdom) might also be candidates for potential growth, but generally it would be helpful to have more detailed data on customers and their behaviour (e.g., historical changes, demographics) in order to be able to make better recommendations. 

# Should the store continue to buy full albums from record labels?
## 1. Find out how many sales were for full albums versus individual tracks
```{sql, connection=conn, output.var="albums_vs_ind"}
--This was a particularly difficult part of the exercise and caused much confusion on the discussion forums as well, so I break down the purpose of each step here using comments

--First, get the first track of each invoice and define new table invoice_first_track (ifs)
WITH invoice_first_track AS
    (
     SELECT
         il.invoice_id invoice_id,
         MIN(il.track_id) first_track_id
     FROM invoice_line il
     GROUP BY 1
    )
SELECT --then select final columns (including is_album which hasn't been defined yet)
    is_album,
    COUNT(invoice_id) AS n_invoices,
    CAST(COUNT(invoice_id) AS FLOAT) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoice) AS percent
FROM --then define the subset of invoice_first_track to select from
    (
    SELECT
        ifs.*, --i.e., all values of ifs where
        CASE
            WHEN
                 (--the difference between the list of tracks corresponding to each invoice in ifs
                  SELECT il2.track_id FROM invoice_line il2
                  WHERE il2.invoice_id = ifs.invoice_id
                   
                  EXCEPT -- and the list of tracks belonging to albums to which tracks in invoice_first_track belong
                  
                  SELECT t.track_id FROM track t 
                  WHERE t.album_id = (
                                      SELECT t2.album_id FROM track t2
                                      WHERE t2.track_id = ifs.first_track_id

                  EXCEPT -- and the list of tracks belonging to the albums to which the tracks in ifs belong
                  SELECT t.track_id FROM track t
                  WHERE t.album_id = (

                                      WHERE t2.track_id = ifs.first_track_id
                                     ) 
                 ) IS NULL -- is null
             THEN "1" -- fill the new column of ifs is_album with 1 if the above differences are NULL (i.e., the purchases are for whole albums), and 0 if they are not (i.e., the purchases are for individual tracks)
             ELSE "0"
         END AS "is_album"
     FROM invoice_first_track ifs
    )
GROUP BY is_album;

```

## 2. Visualization
```{r plot prop album sales, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
colour <- brewer.pal(3, "Set3")

pie(albums_vs_ind$percent, labels = c("tracks", "albums"), border = "white", col = colour, main = "Total sales")

# Note: while pie and donut charts are generally a bad idea for data viz because it can be difficult to grasp the relative magnitude of each "slice", in this particular case it's alright because there are only two categories of sales to represent (tracks and albums) and it makes a nice change from bar charts. 
```

## Conclusion: 
Whole albums represent approximately 20% of all sales, which is a large proportion. It doesn't make sense to change strategy and focus on buying individual popular tracks. 

# "Bonus" questions:
1. which artist is used the most in playlists?
2. How many tracks have been purchased vs not purchased?
3. Does the range of tracks in the store reflect their sales popularity?
4. Do protected vs non-protected media types have an effect on popularity?


## 1. Which artist features most often in playlists?
There are two ways we could define "most used" here - artists with the most tracks contained in playlists, and artists who have at least 1 track in the most playlists. Data for both definitions is gathered here:
```{sql, connection=conn, output.var="artist_pop"}
WITH playlist_info AS (
SELECT p.*, pt.*, t.*, g.*
FROM playlist AS p
INNER JOIN playlist_track AS pt ON pt.playlist_id = p.playlist_id
INNER JOIN track AS t ON t.track_id = pt.track_id
INNER JOIN genre AS g On g.genre_id = t.genre_id
),
  artist_info AS (
  SELECT ar.*, al.*
  FROM album AS al
  INNER JOIN artist AS ar ON ar.artist_id = al.artist_id
  ),
  
  playlists_with_artists AS (
  SELECT 
  pi.playlist_id AS playlist_id,
  ai.artist_id AS artist_id,
  ai.name AS artist_name,
  COUNT(pi.track_id) AS n_tracks
  FROM playlist_info AS pi
  INNER JOIN artist_info AS ai ON ai.album_id = pi.album_id
  GROUP BY playlist_id, artist_name
  )
  
SELECT 
artist_name,
artist_id,
COUNT(playlist_id) AS n_playlists,
n_tracks
FROM playlists_with_artists AS pwa
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY n_tracks DESC;

```

```{r display poptab}
head(artist_pop)
```


```{r plot artist pop 1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
artist_top10_tracks <- artist_pop %>% slice_max(order_by = n_tracks, with_ties = TRUE, n = 10)

tracks <- ggplot(data = artist_top10_tracks, aes(x = reorder(artist_name, n_tracks), y = n_tracks)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "hotpink1") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of tracks") 


tracks

```
```{r plot artist pop 2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
artist_top10_play <- artist_pop %>% slice_max(order_by = n_playlists, with_ties = TRUE, n = 10)

play <- ggplot(data = artist_top10_play, aes(x = reorder(artist_name, n_playlists), y = n_playlists)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "hotpink2") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of playlists") 


play
```
Note that the list of "Top 10" artists in terms of the number of playlists they feature in is much longer than just 10. This is because I chose to allow ties when slicing the data - you can see on the graph that most of the artists feature in exactly the same number of playlists. Using `n_tracks` as a secondary ordering variable would not have been useful as there are also lots of ties there. 

## Conclusion:
Most of the top 10 artists in terms of number of tracks featured in playlists are Rock and Metal artists, while most of those whose popularity is defined as the number of playlists they feature in make classical music. The most popular artist is therefore either Iron Maiden or Eugene Ormandy. 
Caveat: there are a few artist names which actually contain several different artists, so this data would have to be processed a bit more to reflect the true number of tracks and playlists per individual artist. This is not the point of this exercise though, and each artist name, whether it contains one or more actual artists, is associated with a single artist ID, which suggests that the store is more interested in the performance of each artist as identified by the ID, so I'm not going to do that processing here.

## 2. How many tracks have been purchased vs not purchased?
```{sql, connection=conn, output.var="tracks_purchased"}
WITH purchased_tracks AS (
    SELECT 
        i.invoice_id AS invoice_id,
        il.track_id AS track_id
    FROM invoice AS i
    INNER JOIN invoice_line AS il
    )
    
SELECT 
   COUNT(DISTINCT t.track_id) AS n_tracks_total,
   COUNT(DISTINCT pt.track_id) AS n_tracks_purchased,
   CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT pt.track_id) AS FLOAT)/(COUNT(DISTINCT t.track_id)) AS prop_purchased
FROM track AS t
LEFT JOIN purchased_tracks AS pt ON pt.track_id = t.track_id;

```

```{r display tab}
tracks_purchased

```
1806 of the 3503 available tracks were purchased, or about 50%. This seems a bit low, which may indicate that the range of tracks the store has available doesn't reflect their relative popularity as well as it could. This leads us to the next question:

## 3. Does the range of tracks in the store reflect their sales popularity?
```{sql, connection=conn, output.var="track_pop_range"}
WITH track_range AS (
    SELECT
        g.*,
        t.track_id AS track_id,
        t.genre_id AS genre_id
    FROM genre AS g
    INNER JOIN track AS t ON g.genre_id = t.genre_id
    ),
    sold_range AS (
    SELECT
        t.genre_id AS genre_id,
        il.track_id AS track_id,
        i.invoice_id As invoice_id
    FROM invoice_line AS il
    INNER JOIN track AS t ON t.track_id = il.track_id
    INNER JOIN invoice AS i ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id
    )

SELECT 
    tr.name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT tr.track_id) AS n_tracks,
    COUNT(DISTINCT sr.track_id) AS n_sold,
    RANK () OVER ( 
		ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT tr.track_id) DESC
		) AS tot_rank,
		RANK () OVER ( 
		ORDER BY COUNT(DISTINCT sr.track_id) DESC
		) AS sold_rank,
		CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT sr.track_id) AS FLOAT)/COUNT(DISTINCT tr.track_id) AS prop_sold
FROM track_range AS tr
LEFT JOIN sold_range AS sr ON sr.genre_id = tr.genre_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY sold_rank;

```

```{r display pop range}
track_pop_range_long <- track_pop_range %>% select(c(1:3)) %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(n_tracks, n_sold), names_to = "type", values_to = "n")

track_pop_range
```

```{r plot pop, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pop_range <- ggplot(data = track_pop_range_long, aes(x = reorder(name, n), y = n, fill = type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of tracks") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.8, 0.3))

pop_range

```
```{r plot prop_sold, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pop_range <- ggplot(data = track_pop_range, aes(x = reorder(name, prop_sold), y = prop_sold)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Available tracks sold") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

pop_range

```

## Conclusion:
We can see from the first plot that, in terms of the number of tracks available in the store, the range looks mostly representative of each genre's popularity (defined as the number of sales), with a few exceptions. For example, there are many more Latin tracks than are actually sold. 

Another way to represent how well the number of tracks matches each genre's popularity could be to consider the proportion of tracks sold for each genre. Selections with a higher proportion of tracks sold are more likely to be representative of their genre's popularity since they don't have too many extra (unsold) tracks, while those with lower proportions of tracks sold are less so. However, having a very high percentage of tracks sold can also indicate that there are very few tracks available, or that there may be a higher demand for the genre in question (there aren't enough extra tracks). 

We can compare the number of tracks available to the number of tracks sold to see if it's the first possibility, but other data like historical data on customers' purchasing patterns for each genre would be needed to look into the second possibility. It would also be useful to survey customers, e.g., to find out whether they wish there were more tracks for certain genres.

## 4. Does media type (protected vs non-protected) have an effect on popularity?
We will define popularity as the number of sales. Let's break down the number of sales between these two media types:
```{sql, connection=conn, output.var="media_type_effect"}
WITH track_info AS (
     SELECT 
          t.track_id AS track_id,
          t.genre_id AS genre_id,
          g.name AS genre,

    )
    
SELECT 
  ti.media_type AS media_type,

GROUP BY media_type
ORDER BY n_sold DESC;
  
```

```{r, display effect media type}
media_type_effect

```

Plot the resulting data:
```{r, plot media type effect, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

type <- ggplot(data = media_type_effect, aes(x = reorder(cat, -n_sold), y = n_sold)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkviolet") +
  xlab("") +
  ylab("Number of tracks sold")

type
```
We can see that most sold tracks are in a non-protected format. However, this can't tell us whether the media type actually *affects* track popularity. We could also see from the table that there are 5 media subtypes, of which MPEG audio files (a non-protected type) are by far the most widespread, so this pattern could just be due to the prevalence of this one format instead of the protected status having an effect on its own. 

Based on this summary, we can't say for sure whether the protected status of the media files has a big effect on sales popularity. To do that, we need to use statistical methods, like regression. This will allow us to quantify how well media type predicts track popularity. 

To use a regression, we need more detailed data than is in the previous table: 
```{sql, connection=conn, output.var="media_type_detailed"}

WITH tracks_info AS (    
    SELECT 
          t.track_id AS track_id,
          g.name AS genre,
          m.name AS media_type,
          CASE 
            WHEN m.name LIKE "%protected%" THEN "protected"
            ELSE "non-protected"
          END AS cat
    FROM track AS t
    INNER JOIN genre AS g ON g.genre_id = t.genre_id
    INNER JOIN media_type AS m ON m.media_type_id = t.media_type_id
    )
    
SELECT
    ti.*,
    CASE
      WHEN il.track_id = ti.track_id THEN 1
      ELSE 0
     END AS sold
FROM tracks_info AS ti
LEFT JOIN invoice_line AS il ON il.track_id = ti.track_id
GROUP BY 1;

```

```{r display detailed media type}
head(media_type_detailed)
```
The dependent variable is `sold`, a dichotomous (binary) variable, so logistic regression is the best kind of statistical model for this data. 

```{r logistic regression}
library(stats)
library(sjPlot)

t1 <- glm(data = media_type_detailed, sold ~ cat, family = "binomial")
#summary(t1)

t2 <- glm(data = media_type_detailed, sold ~ cat + media_type, family = "binomial")
summary(t2)

anova(t1, t2, test = "Chisq") # does t1 fit significantly better than t2?


tab_model(t2)


```
Note: the warning we get with the best-fitting model (which includes both general media type, and media sub-type as predictors) means that there was not enough data corresponding to `Protected MPEG-4 video file` to evaluate how well this sub-type predicted the relative odds of a track being sold. 

This makes sense, because only 3 such tracks were sold. It is probably more appropriate to use a penalized likelihood logistic (or Firth-Logistic) regression which can handle such unbalanced data better than the typical version based on maximum likelihood estimation.

```{r firths}
library(logistf)
m_pen <- logistf(data = media_type_detailed, sold ~ media_type )
summary(m_pen)
exp(coef(m_pen)) # get odds ratios

m_pen_cat <- logistf(data = media_type_detailed, sold ~ cat)
summary(m_pen_cat)
exp(coef(m_pen_cat))

# note that a model containing both predictors is difficult to generate with this process: R throws a warning that the resulting p-values are unreliable because the maximum number of iterations for the model estimation has been exceeded. Therefore, let us consider each model individually for the purposes of this toy example (in real life we would need to take steps to actually resolve this issue).

```

```{r disconnect db}
dbDisconnect(conn)
```

## Conclusion:
Our models indicate that media type does affect whether a track gets sold (protected media types get sold less), but it appears that the sub-types have little significant effect on track popularity (the protected MPEG-4 type seems to decrease the odds of a track being sold compared to the other types). Non-protected media types are therefore more popular.
