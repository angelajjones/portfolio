# Active learning strategies in child- and adulthood: a summary of my PhD work
In this section of my portfolio, I want to summarise what my PhD work was about in general, and explain the results of a few of the studies I ran. This section is intended for anyone who is curious about this kind of research and just wants to get a general feeling for it. 

I start with a (very) brief summary of the main points for the reader who's in a hurry or just wants a general idea of what I worked on. For the more interested or determined reader, I follow that up with a more detailed overview of the relevant background of my studies and some short explanations of two of the studies I ran.

# Keep it short: take-home messages about active learning
- Active learning refers to self-directed learning, where the learner chooses what information to look at next and when. A learning strategy is the particular approach a learner uses to learn and apply new information. 

- Finding out more about how active learning works in children will help us better understand how adults learn and also how to design new, interactive teaching methods that really work.

- Active learning strategies change a lot between the ages of 5 and 10, with 5, 7 and 10 years of age being important milestones. Strategies generally progress from being less efficient and less effective at younger ages to more efficient and more effective at older ages, with characteristic jumps in efficiency happening around age 7 and progressing to almost adult-like levels around age 10. 

- Active learning strategies can be deconstructed into 3 building blocks:
    - the way task-relevant information is structured (i.e., the hypothesis space, which can be thought of as a kind of task-specific database),
    - what learners care about when selecting new information to look at (i.e., sampling strategies),
    - and how flexible they are in adapting their strategies to different contexts (i.e., adaptiveness).
    
- Studies have already shown that young children are highly adaptable and can tailor their strategies depending on the learning context, but we know much less about the other two building blocks. 

- My studies have shown that 5- to 7-year-olds think about task-relevant information (i.e., hypothesis space structure) in increasingly complex, sophisticated ways, which allows older children to complete certain learning tasks more successfully. The structure of their hypothesis space also changed between them learning some new information and having to use that information to make predictions. Two conclusions can be drawn from this information: 
    - Being able to use a more sophisticated hypothesis space structure is a necessary step for being able to execute more efficient learning strategies and being a more successful learner overall, and 
     - The stability of the hypothesis space structure throughout a task may be another element which changes with age, with older learners being able to maintain the same structure throughout a whole task. 
       
- I have also shown that when searching for new information, adults want to learn as much as possible, but when they have limits to the amount of information they can uncover and have monetary rewards at stake, they're also unwilling to sacrifice the accuracy of their predictions, so they spend some time confirming that what they've already learned is true. In other words, they tend to balance reducing their general uncertainty about their environment with the need to make accurate predictions which will result in high pay-offs. It's important to note that this is true irrespective of the kind of task at hand, as long as it involves some kind of performance-dependent reward. This is notable because it shows that learners recycle certain kinds of learning approaches between some tasks. In children, how much they recycle their strategies between tasks may change with age and this may contribute to some of the observed changes in strategy.

- To conclude, observed changes in active learning strategies between the ages of 5 and 10 are probably driven both by changes in how children mentally represent task-relevant information, and by differences in how much they recycle specific approaches to learning between various kinds of tasks. Further research into these questions will help us properly understand exactly how active learning works, which has potential implications for all kinds of teaching methods. 


If you want to know more about all those points, I've provided more details below. 
# What is active learning?
Before getting into may main research questions, let's think about what **active learning** actually means.
Depending on your background, it could mean many different things, but in my field, it refers to **self-directed** learning. In other words, active learning refers to any kind of learning process where the learner is the one who decides what to look at next and when, when they're trying to learn something.
One of the most direct ways to illustrate this is to think of question asking. Asking questions is a very effective way to find information, and everyone from young children to adults makes use of this **learning strategy**. 
During a question asking exchange, the learner is the one who decides what they want to know and who they want to ask for information - the one who answers doesn't usually decide for them. Of course, in practise, these situations aren't quite as one-sided as that and there are many factors to consider, like the relationship between the question asker and the informer, the thoroughness of the answer, the informer's reliability, and how on-topic the answer was, but it's useful to think of them in this black and white way if you're just interested in the learning strategy. 

A **learning strategy** is the approach chosen by the learner to reach a certain learning goal. This could be just wanting to learn some facts. For example, what's a dhole? What would _you_ do to find out? Nowadays, most people would probably just Google it. This in itself is still a learning strategy though: you have a question, you know where to start looking for the answer (Google), you type the search query and then quickly evaluate the first few results to choose a link to click on and read its content, then store the information in your memory bank (for reference, a dhole is an endangered species of Asian wild dog related to the African wild dog). And voil√°, learning strategy executed. 
If the word _strategy_ brings to mind chess and other games with many convoluted steps for you, then this might not seem like much, but it still counts. Consider what might happen with broader or more long-term learning goals or problems; what if your goal is to learn how to knit or to learn how to code? You'd need to come up with a long-term, multi-step strategy to do that. It's a similar approach to the fact-finding example I just used, but on a different scale. 

## What do children's active learning strategies look like?
Studies of children's active learning strategies between the ages of 5 and 10 show that they tend to move from relatively inefficient learning strategies (i.e., ones that take an unnecessarily long time, or number of steps, to reach the learning goal) to more efficient ones based on more abstract thinking and the ability to pinpoint the most relevant or important information. The most important shifts in strategy happen at age 5, 7, and 10. So, these ages seem to be key milestones in the development of learning strategies. But why? 

If you want to find out how I started answering that question without reading the next section on how we study active learning in the lab, click [here](#why-do-active-learning-strategies-change-with-age).

## Active learning in the lab
The kinds of learning goals adults come up with (e.g., learning to knit or code) are too complicated to study in the lab right now. Instead, we focus on the kinds of active learning that children naturally engage in while learning about their world growing up. If you're asking yourself why we would bother to focus on this instead of trying to tackle questions about learning that are more relevant to our adult lives, my short answer is that in order to understand how we, as adults, learn on our own, we need to understand how we did it as children. Children are champion learners, learning to walk, talk and understand basic physics like the effects of gravity and conservation of volume, all within the first 2-4 years of their life. Adults teach and guide them, but children have a lot of control over their learning process and will not learn anything an adult is trying to teach them if they're not interested in it. In addition, the current educational interest in making classroom activities more interactive, more "active" for children, thinking that this will boost learning, is another reason why we should be studying how children naturally learn, so we can adapt educational methods appropriately. Unfortunately, this field of research is not yet advanced enough to apply any of our insights directly to the classroom, but it's important to keep studying active learning so that it is possible in future.

To illustrate how researchers study children's learning strategies, let's go back to thinking about games, because most research on active learning with children takes the form of games. One of the most well-known is the **20 Questions game**. In case you haven't heard of it, the 20 Questions game usually has at least two players: a question asker and an informant, who answers the questions. There are some sets of items between the players, for example faces, that can be split into different categories (e.g., male/female, glasses/no glasses, hair/bald...). The game goes roughly like this: in each round, the informant chooses one of the items (e.g., the bald man with glasses and a beard), and the question asker has to ask only yes/no questions (i.e., where the answer can only be yes or no) to find out which item the informant chose (the "target"). 

This is a fun game that can be played casually but is also very useful from a scientific perspective because it allows researchers to see what kinds of strategies question askers use at different ages, and how efficient they are (i.e., how many questions are needed to find the target - the fewer the better). Learners who stick to asking about _categories_ of items (e.g., is it a man?) tend to find the target faster than those who ask about one item at a time (e.g., is it that woman with glasses and red hair?) because each question allows them to eliminate several possibilities at once. Studies using this game to investigate how 5- to 10-year-old children approach this task have shown that 5- to 7-year-olds tend to only ask about one item at a time, while 7-to 10-year-olds start using more efficient strategies by asking about categories of items, with 10-year-olds behaving almost like adults, who almost always ask about item categories.

# Why do active learning strategies change with age? 
Considering the ages at which major changes in learning strategies happen, it's a no-brainer (hah) to think of brain maturation and the development of key cognitive skills like verbal skills, memory, and executive functions (this refers to the set of skills that allows us to pay attention to relevant things and block out irrelevant ones, make plans, and change our priorities on the fly). It's likely that these things are very important factors in these changes but we don't have a clear picture of which cognitive skills enable which kinds of learning strategies or why. 

Another way to think about this issue is from a computational standpoint. In other words, this involves deconstructing active learning strategies into building blocks, and then making models (which we can run on computers) of what these building blocks look like in children, by getting them to do various learning tasks in the form of games. Once broken down in this way, we can see which of the building blocks might change with age, and how. This is the way I went during my PhD, rather than concentrating on cognitive skills. 

## The building blocks of active learning strategies
Active learning strategies can be theoretically broken down into three main components:
- The hypothesis space (i.e., the structured mental representation of the information gathered during the task),
- Sampling strategies (i.e., what learners care about the most when choosing what to look at next, for instance, do they care most about being right or about exploring all their possibilities?),
- Adaptiveness (i.e., the ability to tailor a strategy to the specific task at hand, because no strategy is best all the time).

Of course, cognitive skills play a huge role too, and are necessary to make all of these building blocks work. The diagram below summarises this breakdown.

  <em>The building blocks of active learning strategies:<br>what every learner needs in order to interact with and learn about the world around them.</em>
</p>

Studies have already shown that children are very adaptable in applying their strategies from a very young age (~4 to 5 years), so it's unlikely that this building block would change enough to cause the observed changes in learning strategies between the ages of 5 and 10. But what about the other two? Very little was known about the **hypothesis space** or **sampling strategies** when I started, so I focused on them.

# Changes in how information is represented in the mind
> NOTE:
> It's better if you've read the previous section on the [building blocks of active learning](#the-building-blocks-of-active-learning-strategies) to properly understand the following sections.

The **hypothesis space** refers to the way information relevant to a learning task is represented in the mind of a learner. This sounds very abstract and might not make intuitive sense, but hopefully, using one of my studies to illustrate the concept will help. But first, why is the hypothesis space important? It's important because learners need to keep track of what they're learning as they go along. How else would we know where the gaps in our knowledge are? Keeping track of both what we _already_ know, and what we still _don't_ know but need to in order to achieve a certain learning goal is crucial for deciding which information to look for next. That means the hypothesis space functions a bit like a database and a GPS at the same time, in that it stores information in a structured way and also directs the learner towards new information that will help fill in the gaps in their knowledge. 
It also means that the exact _structure_ of this database-GPS-hybrid has a big influence on what the learner's strategy looks like, so we can reverse-engineer the structure of their hypothesis space from their learning behaviour by using carefully designed tasks. That's exactly what we did in this study.

## The game
We came up with a basic tablet game for 5- to 7-year-olds, which was divided into a _learning phase_ and a _test phase._ In the learning phase, we showed them four monsters at the top of the screen.
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align = "center">
  <em>The four "learning" monsters.</em>
</p>

These monsters were all the "cute" kind (potentially upsetting young children with scary monsters is a big no-no) and differed in their _colour_ and _shape_, as you can see in the image above. We told children that these monsters lived on a planet called Apres and loved to race each other. The aim of the game was to learn which _kinds_ of monsters were faster and to learn to predict which ones would win a race. 
So, in the learning phase, children would watch the learning monsters race and see who the winner was every time, and then in the test phase, they would be shown some new pairs of monsters and asked to predict which one in each pair would win a race. 
Since this was an _active_ learning task, children chose their own monster pairs to see racing in the learning phase, and dragged each monster down to the starting line on the racetrack. They had to watch at least 3 races, but they could also choose to see as many as they wanted after that point before moving on to the test phase. 

In the test phase, we showed them three new monster pairs, which were different from the learning monsters but had at least one similar characteristic (e.g., a different colour but the same shape, or vice-versa), and asked them which one would win a race between each pair.

</p>

After this prediction task, we showed them the learning monsters again and asked them to arrange them on a podium from fastest to slowest, to check how well they remembered what they had learned at the beginning. 

## Assessing learning outcomes
Before thinking about how children might have represented the information about the monsters during this task, let's focus on how well they actually did. We found that they got better with age at predicting which monster in each new pair was faster: 
- 5-year-olds correctly predicted the winning monster 57% of the time, 
- 6-year-olds 69% of the time, 
- and 7-year-olds 76% of the time. 

We found a similar age-related increase in accuracy when we considered how well children remembered the information they had gathered during the learning phase: 
- 19% of 5-year-olds, 
- 16% of 6-year-olds and 
- 37% of 7-year-olds correctly sorted the learning monsters from fastest to slowest in the podium task. 

To summarise, the ability to learn the relationship between monsters' _colour_ and _shape_, and their relative speed, improved with age, and so did children's retention of the information gathered during the learning phase, with a particularly big increase in memory accuracy between ages 6 and 7. 

In many ways, it makes sense that being able to remember the information they gathered initially would help predict the winning monsters in the test phase, so it's not surprising that 7-year-olds were the best at the prediction task, given that they also remembered the most information about the monsters. However, 5- and 6-year-olds were better at predicting the winning monsters than the quality of their memory suggested, which pointed to something more complicated going on than simply "remember as much as possible and apply that information directly to new items." This is where the structure of their hypothesis space comes in.

## Reverse-engineering children's hypothesis space
Broadly speaking, there are 2 possible ways to think about the information about the learning monsters: 
1. Simply trying to remember the specific order of each monster (e.g., the blue round one is the fastest, followed by the green round one, followed by the blue square one, followed by the green square one). 
2. Extracting a set of "rules" governing the relationships between the monsters' characteristics (colour and shape) and their speed (e.g., blue monsters are faster than green monsters, and round monsters are faster than square monsters. But if there's a blue square monster [winning colour + losing shape] racing against a green round monster [losing colour + winning shape], the blue one wins because colour is more important than shape in determining speed). 

In the first case, there's no need for very complex cognitive processes to keep track of the information - the learner just tries to remember the the relative speed of each monster they saw. Since we're talking about an _active_ learning task, this means that when they choose which monsters to see racing against each other, they do so according to a set of potential monster orders, and choose monster pairs that help them rule out specific ones (e.g., choosing between the possibility that the green round monster is faster than the blue round monster, which is faster than the green round monster, which is itself faster than the blue square monster, and the possibility that the correct order of monsters is actually blue square, green round, blue square, then green round). This means that their learning decisions can give us a window into how the information about the monsters' speed is structured in their mind during the learning phase. This kind of structure is what we call a **permutation-based hypothesis space**, because the learner thinks about the monsters' relative speed in terms of the possible _permutations_, or orders of monsters.

In the second case, instead of thinking at the level of individual monsters, the learner adds a layer of abstraction to their reasoning by thinking instead about the _rules_ that predict the relationship between the monsters' characteristics and their speed. This is more cognitively complex because they have to observe a race and not only remember which monster won, but also _deduce_ how each characteristic (colour, shape) leads to differences in monster speed. For example, if they see a green round monster win against a blue round monster, they can see the only difference between the monsters is their colour and infer that green monsters are faster than blue monsters. This extra layer of reasoning leads to a very different information structure in the learner's mind, because the information is organized around sets of possible _rules_ about monster speed, instead of staying focused on individual monsters. Therefore, a learner with this kind of representation in mind will make learning decisions that try to rule out different potential _rules_. Incidentally, adults tend to approach this sort of task in this manner. This is a highly efficient approach for this kind of learning task if learners can manage it, because it not only allows them to find the correct set of rules in three steps (e.g., first, observe the results of a race between monsters differing only in colour, then in shape, and finally, pit a monster with the losing colour and the winning shape against one with the winning shape and the losing colour to determine whether colour or shape is more important for determining their speed), but also pretty much guarantees that they'll be able to successfully predict the relative speed of new monsters as long as they obey the same rules. This type of representation is called a **cue-abstraction or cue-based hypothesis space** (cue refers to each monster characteristic).

To determine which of these two models of the hypothesis space fit children's behaviour better, we compared their learning decisions _and_ their prediction and podium decisions to what each model said a learner should do during learning, and how well their decisions during the test phase fit with the predicted behaviour and amount of information gathered during learning. The better each model fit children's data, the more likely it is that children's hypothesis space structure matched the one in the model. 

What we found was that the hypothesis space structure didn't stay the same throughout our task: during the learning phase, it was structured one way, and the structure changed for some children in the test phase. Five-year-olds mostly followed a permutation-based structure during learning, but didn't seem to follow either kind during the test phase. Six-year-olds followed the permutation-based model during the whole task, and 7-year-olds followed the permutation-based model during the learning phase but tended to switch to the cue-based model during the test phase. 

To summarise, five-year-olds had the most trouble maintaining a coherent hypothesis-space and generally started with a permutation-based structure but seemed to have resorted to a completely different approach when asked to use the information gathered during learning to make predictions. Six-year-olds stuck with a permutation-based structure, and 7-year-olds also started with that structure but switched to a more abstract, more efficient cue-based structure when they needed to apply their knowledge to predict the relative speed of new monsters. 

## Take-home messages
There are two novel discoveries here:
1. The hypothesis space does not necessarily remain the same throughout a task, despite previous research assuming that this was the case.
2. The ability to structure task-relevant information in a more abstract, efficient way begins to emerge around age 7 and probably contributes to the shift towards more efficient learning strategies observed around this age.

This means that this particular building block of active learning strategies, the hypothesis space, probably develops quite a lot from the age of 5, with 7 being an important milestone that marks the emergence of more sophisticated ways of representing information. Since this mirrors the patterns of change in active learning strategies, it is likely that the ability to mentally organise information in this way is a necessary step for being able to execute efficient active learning strategies; until children are able to do this, they are seemingly stuck with less efficient approaches to active learning. The fact that 7-year-olds were only able to use this kind of hypothesis space structure after a fashion also suggests that another element which changes with age is the _stability_ of the mental representation of information. In other words, older children (and adults) may keep the same (efficient) hypothesis space structure throughout a whole task, while younger children don't yet have the cognitive skills to achieve this. However, it's also possible that changeability is also just a general feature of the hypothesis space, and it's common to find that it changes during a learning task at any age. Nobody has explicitly investigated this question yet, so someone will need to do that before we can know for sure.
