# Active learning strategies in child- and adulthood: what did I find out?
In this section of my portfolio, I want to summarise what my PhD work was about in general, and explain the results of a few of the studies I ran. This section is intended for anyone who is curious about this kind of research and just wants to get a general feeling for it.
For those who want a little bit more depth on some of the theory or technical details, I have added/am in the process of adding collapsible sections with that information, but you don't need to read them to understand everything.

# What is active learning?
Before getting into the main questions I tried to answer through my research, let's just think about what **active learning** actually means.
Depending on your background, it could mean many different things, but in my field, it refers to **self-directed** learning. In other words, active learning refers to any kind of learning process where the learner is the one who decides what to look at next and when, when they're trying to learn something.
One of the most direct ways to illustrate this is to think of question asking. Asking questions is a very effective way to find information, and everyone from young children to adults makes use of this **learning strategy**. 
During a question asking exchange, the learner is the one who decides what they want to know and who they want to ask for information - the one who answers doesn't usually decide for them. Of course, in practise, these situations aren't quite as one-sided as that and there are many factors to consider, like the thoroughness of the answer, the informer's reliability, and how on-topic the answer was, but it's useful to think of them in this black and white way if you're just interested in the learning strategy. 

A **learning strategy** is the approach chosen by the learner to reach a certain learning goal. This could be just wanting to learn some facts, for example, what's a dhole? What would you do in this case? Nowadays, most people would probably just Google it. This in itself is still a learning strategy though: you have a question, you know where to start looking for the answer (Google), you type the search query and then quickly evaluate the first few results to choose a link to click on and read its content (for reference, a dhole is an endangered species of Asian wild dog related to the African wild dog). And voil√°, learning strategy executed. 
If the word _strategy_ brings to mind chess and other games with many convoluted steps for you, then this might not seem like much of a strategy, but it still counts. Consider also what might happen with broader or more long-term learning goals or problems; what if your goal is to learn how to knit or to learn how to code? You'd need to come up with a long-term, multi-step strategy to do that.
However, these kinds of goals are too complicated to study in the lab right now. Instead, we focus on the kinds of active learning which children naturally engage in while learning about their world growing up. To illustrate this, let's go back to thinking about games.
