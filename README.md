# About this portfolio
Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.
This is a collection of my personal data analysis projects which I'm going to keep adding to along my journey in data analytics, data science, and visualization. 
My background is in psychological research: for my PhD, I studied active learning strategies in children and adults, and this is what sparked my interest in all things data! I liked working with data so much that I decided to keep expanding my skills in that area and start applying them in a business setting, and the main purpose of this portfolio is to keep track of my progress. If you're also interested in what I worked on during my PhD though, I've added a section which summarises my studies in an accessible way. 

I've separated the projects according to their main focus and/or the programming languages and software I used.

## Goals for the future
For now, I have decided to focus on building my analytical skills (aside from SQL) using R, because I am already very comfortable with it and I think it's better to build up a thorough understanding of more advanced techniques such as machine learning from a solid base. With a solid understanding of how these techniques work, it will be easier to implement them in another language like Python. I am also curious about other programming languages like Julia, and plan to eventually include them in my skillset as well.
