# My data analytics portfolio
A collection of my personal data analysis projects which I'm going to keep adding to on my journey in data analytics and visualization. 
Here's a [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/angela.jones1086#!/) to the visualizations I've been doing on Tableau Public. I joined recently and am slowly adding to them by taking part in MOOCs and participating in community projects like #MakeoverMonday and #VOTD.

My projects are separated into different folders depending on their focus and/or purpose. 

The `science on stage` folder contains the work I did to clean, process and analyse user data from the Clickmeeting and Microsoft Teams APIs for Science on Stage's webinars while volunteering for them as a data analyst, posted here with their permission. There are two RMarkdown scripts - ome for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis and one for carrying out the analysis - and one example report. Although I was responsible for the bulk of this work, I was part of a cross-functional team and have marked the script sections contributed by my team members accordingly. The corresponding report visualizing this data is also posted with the company's permission; note that it has been generated using entirely synthetic data for demonstration purposes and does not represent the actual user profiles of Science on Stage e.V. webinars. 

The `SQL` folder contains projects that I completed as part of MOOC courses to develop my SQL skills (e.g., through Dataquest and Coursera). These are 'toy' business problems that nonetheless are designed to demonstrate competence in solving real-world business problems. Such problems often require several different skills (e.g., data visualization and statistical analysis), so these projects also integrate these skills where appropriate. The SQL dialects I have learned so far are SQLite and MySQL, as well as Teradata to a lesser extent. 

My machine learning projects are - you guessed it - in the `machine learning` folder. I will be adding to this using datasets and problems from Kaggle and other sources to explore and build skills in several different kinds of supervised machine learning to start, but I plan to work my way up to unsupervised machine learning techniques as well.
