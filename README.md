# About this portfolio
Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.
This is a collection of my personal data analysis projects which I'm going to keep adding to along my journey in data analytics, data science, and visualization. 
My background is in psychological research: for my PhD, I studied active learning strategies in children and adults, and this is what sparked my interest in all things data! I liked working with data so much that I decided to keep expanding my skills in that area and start applying them in a business setting, and the main purpose of this portfolio is to keep track of my progress. If you're also interested in what I worked on during my PhD though, I've added a section which summarises my studies in an accessible way. 

I've separated the projects according to their main focus and/or the programming languages and software I used.

## Goals for the future
Right now, I'm working on developing my skills in machine learning and Python, but there are so many interesting aspects of data science to cover! In future, I'd also like to learn Julia, more SQL dialects, and work with unstructured data. From a more content-based perspective, I plan to learn more advanced and/or diverse machine learning techniques like KNN, random forests and neural networks, as well as pushing my boundaries in data visualization.
